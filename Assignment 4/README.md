# Assignment 5

This assignment was designed to take any tabular data series from NYC Open Data and allow a user 
of your program to do some basic data mining on it. For my program, I used the FDNY's Firehouse listings 
(https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/FDNY-Firehouse-Listing/hc8x-tcnd).
