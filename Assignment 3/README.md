# Assignment 3

This assignment was designed to open any text file specified by the user, and analyze the frequency of verbal ticks in the text. 
Since there are many different kinds of verbal ticks (such as "like", "uh", "um", "you know", etc) the program asks 
the user what ticks to look for. A user can enter multiple ticks, separated by commas. The program should output: the total 
number of tics found in the text, the density of tics (proportion of all words in the text that are tics), the 
frequency of each of the verbal tics, and the percentage that each tic represents out of all the total number of tics.
